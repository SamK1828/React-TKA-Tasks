# 🎇 Diwali Homework — JavaScript & React Assignment Dashboard

An interactive React project that combines **20 JavaScript problems** and **20 React exercises** into one unified dashboard.  
It’s built using **React + Vite**, demonstrating mastery in JavaScript logic, DOM handling, React state management, props, routing, and form validation.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This project was created as part of the **Diwali Homework Assignment** to practice:

- JavaScript logic building (arrays, recursion, async, DOM)
- React fundamentals (components, props, state)
- Advanced React (forms, routing, CRUD, conditional rendering)
- Clean modular architecture for scalability

---

## 🧠 Features

### JavaScript Section

- 20 logical & functional problems implemented in pure JavaScript
- Includes:
  - Array manipulation, flattening, intersection
  - Async data fetching (API calls)
  - DOM-based examples (table generation, animation)
  - Caching, pagination, rate-limiting, and more
- All problems are runnable interactively in the browser

### React Section

- 20 React assignments implemented as independent components:
  - Props & state-based components
  - Forms with validation and controlled inputs
  - Conditional rendering examples
  - Nested routing and reusable components
  - Full CRUD Todo App
- Organized, documented, and easy to extend
